# hitman-neat
Using the NEAT and Pygame library in Python to train a hitman in a two-player shooter game.

# training method
Similar to TechWithTim's training method for his two player pong game, where each member in a population 'battles' against each other, adjusting fitnesses for each accordingly. 

# pickle files
All the "hitman#.pickle" files are the different genomes I tested with. The best hitman was the "V2" one.
